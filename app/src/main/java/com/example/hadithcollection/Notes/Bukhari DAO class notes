NOTE TO FUTURE SELF FOR THESE QUESTIONS:

- What is @Query for
- What is * for
- What is @Insert for
- What is (onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE) for
- Why is there a ? on CachedQuotes?

WHAT IS @QUERY FOR?
Query is a room annotation used to define custom SQL queries for accessing database.
In the Bukhari DAO Query is used to retrieve data from the cached_quotes table.

WHAT IS * FOR?
In the context for Query, * is used to select "all columns" from cached quotes.
This is because we're doing "SELECT * FROM cached_quotes". So we're retrieving all the columns and their values.

WHAT IS @INSERT FOR?
Insert is a room annotation used to define methods for inserting data into the database.
In the BukhariDAO interface @Insert is used to define the cacheQuote() method.

WHAT IS ON-CONFLICT .REPLACE FOR?
This is used with the @Insert annotation to specify the conflicts when inserting data into the table.
In our code we used onConflict to indicate if there's a conflicting data, the existing row will be inserted with the new data.

WHY IS THERE A ? ON CACHEDQUOTES?
This is a nullable type. This means getCachedQuote can either be a non-null CachedQuote object or "null".
Basically if there's a row and ID, it returns a cachedQuote. If theres nothing it'll return "null".
